      <description>Starting off simply: Squaring a number Consider as a really simple example, a function which takes a number and computes the square of that number.
def square(x): return x * x Various appropriate tests of this could check:

      <description>Principles of Software Testing What are the main principles of software testing? Generally, people don&amp;rsquo;t start out writing software with no idea what it should do - they should have some idea of the requirements. The written software must then:
 Meet the original requirements Must respond correctly to different inputs Software must run in a reasonable amount of time Can be installed and run in the intended environment  Static vs Dynamic Testing [Static Testing]{}</description>

      <description>First Steps 1) Make an account on the website https://hub.docker.com
Make the username something sensible as we&amp;rsquo;ll have to use it soon!
1) If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, try &amp;ldquo;docker run ubuntu:18.04&amp;rdquo;. This downloads an image containing Ubuntu 18.04.
2) Now, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a file called &amp;ldquo;Dockerfile&amp;rdquo; in a single folder. The Dockerfile is a configuration script for building an image.
 Create a directory by doing:  mkdir docker-tutorial  Change directory into the folder:  cd docker-tutorial 3) Create a file called Dockerfile in this directory, and put as the first line:</description>

      <description>Quick Notes  Pip install sphinx rather than through apt-get bceause otherwise TZ settings do not work well sphinx-quickstart Most defaults are OK but:
 We want to set default document to markdown rather than RST We want to enable MathJax   Edit conf.py:
 If you want to change the default theme, we can use RTD by changing the line to:
html_theme = &#39;sphinx_rtd_theme&#39;   Uncomment the lines of code here: ```python   If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory, add these directories to sys.</description>

      <description>Continuous Integration What is Continuous Integration?
 Runs the tests repeatedly, every time you make a change. You use a remote service, to avoid having to run all tests locally - useful if they take some time to run. Generally, CI services send you angry emails when tests fail! It requires you to be using version control, and all tests are run when you push your changes to the remote repository.</description>
